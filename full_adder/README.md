# FullAdder
This repository consists of VHDL code for FullAdder circuit realized using half adders. 
The circuits include an OR gate, a half adder, and a full adder constructed using two half adders and an OR gate.

## Entities

### Entity: or_gate
- Architecture: behaviour
- Description: Implements a basic OR gate, where the output (z) is the logical OR of input signals (x and y).

### Entity: half_adder
- Architecture: behaviour
- Description: Implements a half adder, where the sum (s) is the XOR of input signals (a and b), and the carry (c) is the AND of the same input signals.

### Entity: full_adder
- Architecture: behaviour
- Components Used: or_gate, half_adder
- Description: Constructs a full adder using two half adders and an OR gate. The sum (S) is the result of the addition, and the carry-out (C) represents the carry to the next bit.
