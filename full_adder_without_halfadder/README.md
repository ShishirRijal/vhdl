# FullAdder Without Using HalfAdder
This repository contains VHDL code for a full adder implemented as an entity and an architecture. The full adder is designed without using a half adder, providing a concise and straightforward representation of the addition process.

## Contents
### full_adder:
- Entity: full_adder
- Architecture: full_adder1
- Description: Implements a full adder without using a half adder. The entity has three input ports (A, B, C) representing the bits to be added and two output ports (sum, carry) providing the sum and carry-out.
